## What is CodeIgniter

CodeIgniter is an Application Development Framework - a toolkit - for people
who build web sites using PHP. Its goal is to enable you to develop projects
much faster than you could if you were writing code from scratch, by providing
a rich set of libraries for commonly needed tasks, as well as a simple
interface and logical structure to access these libraries. CodeIgniter lets
you creatively focus on your project by minimizing the amount of code needed
for a given task.

### CodeIgniter 3

This repository is for the legacy version, CodeIgniter 3.
`CodeIgniter 4 <https://github.com/codeigniter4/CodeIgniter4>`_ is the latest
version of the framework.

CodeIgniter 3 is the legacy version of the framework, intended for use with PHP
5.6+. This version is in maintenance, receiving mostly just security updates.

### Release Information

This repo contains in-development code for future releases. To download the
latest stable release please visit the `CodeIgniter Downloads
<https://codeigniter.com/download>`_ page.

### Changelog and New Features

You can find a list of all changes for each release in the `user
guide change log <https://github.com/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/blob/develop/user_guide_src/source/changelog.rst>`_.

### Server Requirements

PHP version 5.6 or newer is recommended.

It should work on 5.4.8 as well, but we strongly advise you NOT to run
such old versions of PHP, because of potential security and performance
issues, as well as missing features.
